#Android Portfolio
Greetings! In this portfolio I've included a sample Android application for the purpose of showing
my standard coding practices and formatting. As a user, you can also "summon" any Blizzard legend.

Below I've also included two YouTube video links of projects I've worked on as a 
software engineering consultant:
